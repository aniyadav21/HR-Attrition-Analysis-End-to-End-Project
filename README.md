# **HR Attrition Analysis â€“ End-to-End Project**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
Employee attrition (turnover) is a critical issue for organizations. This project analyzes HR data to identify key factors influencing attrition and provide actionable insights.  

The project is implemented in **two stages**:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python**  
2. **Interactive Dashboard with Power BI**

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Dataset Details**
- **Dataset Name:** HR Attrition Dataset  
- **Records:** 1,470 employees  
- **Features Include:**  
  - `EmployeeNumber`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Department`, `JobRole`, `Attrition`  
  - `MonthlyIncome`, `HourlyRate`, `OverTime`, `YearsAtCompany`  

---

## ðŸ›  **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Power BI:** Dashboard & data visualization  
- **Excel:** Initial data cleaning

## âœ… **Project Workflow**
### **Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
âœ” Removed missing values  
âœ” Renamed inconsistent columns  
âœ” Converted date columns to proper format  

### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**
âœ” Key Python tasks:
- Age distribution visualization  
- Attrition by department and job role (bar plots)  
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features  
- Overtime vs Attrition analysis  

*(Python code and Jupyter Notebook are included in the repository.)*

### **Step 3: Dashboard Development (Power BI)**
âœ” Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI  
âœ” Created KPIs and measures using DAX:
- `Attrition Count`
- `Attrition Rate %`
- `Average Monthly Income`
- `Average Hourly Rate`  
âœ” Built interactive visuals:
- Attrition by Department (Bar Chart)
- Attrition by Job Role (Tree Map)
- Attrition by Age Band (Bar Chart)
- Attrition vs Years at Company (Line Chart)
- Overtime Impact (Pie Chart)
- Income Distribution (Histogram)

## ðŸ“Œ **Key Insights**
- **Overall Attrition Rate:** 16%  
- **By Department:** Research & Development has the highest attrition.  
- **By Job Role:** Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians have the most attrition.  
- **By Age:** Younger employees (18â€“25) leave more often than older groups.  
- **Overtime Impact:** Employees working overtime have a significantly higher attrition rate.
